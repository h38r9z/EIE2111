EIE2111 Lab 3: Control Statements   (Part   1)
Introduction
This laboratory exercise is designed to give you hand-on   experience in   Control   Statements   (Part   1).
Questions
1.       One   large   chemical   company   pays   its   salespeople   on   a   commission   basis.   The   salespeople   each   receives $200 per week plus 9 percent of   their gross sales   for that week.   For   example,   a   salesperson   who   sells   $5000 worth   of chemicals   in   a week receives   $200 plus   9 percent   of $5000,   or   a total   of   $650. Develop   a C++ program that uses   a while   statement   to   input   each   salesperson’s   gross   sales   for   last   week   and   calculates    and   displays   that salesperson’s    earnings.   You    should process one   salesperson’s figure at a time. If   the input is   -1,   the   program   should   exit.
2.       Write   a program   that   reads   the   side   of a   square   and   then prints   a hollow   square   of that   size   out   of   asterisks and blanks. Your program should work for squares of   all   sides between   1 and   20.
3.       A   company   wants   to   transmit   data   over   the   telephone,   but   is   concerned   that   its   phones   could   be   tapped. All   of   the   data   are transmitted   as   four-digit integers. The company has   asked you   to   write   a   program that encrypts the data so that it can be transmitted more securely. Your program should read   a   four-digit   integer   and   encrypt   it   as   follows:   Replace   each   digit   by   (the   代 写EIE2111 Lab 3: Control Statements (Part 1)C/C++
代做程序编程语言sum   of   that   digit   plus   7)   modulus   10. Then, swap the first digit with the third, swap   the   second   digit   with   the   fourth   and print   the   encrypted   integer.   Write   a   separate   program   that   inputs   an   encrypted   four-digit   integer   and   decrypts it to form. the original number.
4.       The   factorial   of   anon-negative   integer   n   is   written   n!   and   is   defined   as   follows:
   
a)      Write   a   program   that   reads   anon-negative   integer, and   computes   and   prints   its   factorial.
b)      Write a program that estimates the value of   the Mathematical constant e by using the   formula
   
Prompt   the   user   for   the   desired   accuracy   (i.e., the   number   of   terms   in   the   summation).
c)      Write a program that computes the value of   ex   by using the formula
   
Prompt   the   user   for   the   desired   accuracy   (i.e., the   number   of   terms   in   the   summation).
5.       Combine the above four programs into one. The   following is   the   sample   output:

Instructions
a.      You   are   required   to   submit   your   C++ programs   (the   whole   projects   created   in   Microsoft Visual   Studio 2019) in Question 5 to Blackboard. Zip all   of   them   into   a   single   file.
b.      The   deadline   of   the   submission: Check   the   course   information.
c.      It is   not   required   to create any classes or   header files for   the above exercises. It is fine if   all   program   codes are in the main program.
