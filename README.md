EIE2111 Lab 4: Control Statements   (Part   2)
Introduction
This laboratory exercise is designed to give you hand-on   experience in   Control   Statements   (Part   2).
Questions
1.       Write   a   program   that   uses   a   for   statement   to   calculate   and   print   the   average   of several   integers.   Assume   the   last   value   read   is   a   sentinel   value   of-100.
2.       Write   a   program   that   uses   a for   statement   to   find   the   smallest   integer   among   several   integers.   Assume   that   the first   value   read specifies   the   number of   integers   remaining.   Note   that   the first   number   is   not   one   of   the   integers   to   compare.
3.       Write a program that uses   for   statements to print the   following   patterns.   Note   that   all   asterisks   (*)   should be printed by a single statement of   the form   cout   <<   '*'.

[Hint:
a.         You should print each pattern separately at the beginning and then   combine them together   after that.

4.       Calculate the value of   π from the infinite   series below:
   Print   a   table   that   shows   the   approximate   value   of   π   in   the   first    1,000   terms   of   this    series.   The   approximation   should be   printed   after   each    100   terms   (i.e.,   100th    term,   200th    term,   and   so   on   until   1000th   term.)
5.       Combine the above four programs into one. The   following is   the   sample   output:

Instructions
a.      You   are   required   to   submit   your   C++ programs   (the   whole   projects   created   in   Microsoft Visual   Studio 2019) in Question 5 to Blackboard. Zip all   of   them   into   a   single   file.
b.      The   deadline   of   the   submission: Check   the   course   information.
c.      It is   not   required   to create any classes or   header files for   the above exercises. It is fine if   all   program   codes are in the main program.
